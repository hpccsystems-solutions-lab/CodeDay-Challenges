# CodeDay - Big Data Challenge

HPCC Systems Solutions Lab is proud to collaborate with [CodeDay Org](https://www.codeday.org/) on Big Data Challenge.

Through the Big Data Challenge students are introduced to big data concepts, they become familiar with ECL (Enterprise Control Language) our big data programming language)=, and they get hands-on practice. During the challenge, students are given sample ECL code and an opportunity to solve challenge questions ranging from easy to mid-level difficulty.
